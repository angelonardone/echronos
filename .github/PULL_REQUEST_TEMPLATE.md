# Motivation

- _What is the status quo and what is problematic about it?_
- _If it is a bug, how can it be reproduced?_

# Goals

- _What is the intended outcome?_
- _Is the solution and approach to it clear cut or do they need to be identified first as part of this?_

# Release Impact: _One of Major, Minor, or Patch (see http://semver.org/ and take all changes visible in release archives into account, including changes to the RTOS API, the build system, the file layout, and the directory hierarchy)_

# Test Plan

_(This section is optional for issues, mandatory for task descriptions and pull requests once a task goes into review)_

- _How can reviewers check whether the goals have been met?_
- _Code review should practically always be included here._
