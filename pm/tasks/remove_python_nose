# Motivation

The Python nose testing framework is currently used for system, unit, and other tests.
It is directly embedded into the repository.
However, most of its features remain unused and provides barely any benefit over the standard library `unittest` package.
Furthermore, the nose framework is obsolete and in maintenance mode.
It therefore constitutes a maintenance burden without providing much benefit.


# Goals

- remove nose framework from repository
- replace its functionality with functionality from `unittest` package


# Test Plan

- code review
- existing regression tests must pass
