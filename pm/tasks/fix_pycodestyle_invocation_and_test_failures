# Motivation

The command `x.py test style` is used in regression testing and currently uses the pycodestyle Python package to check the Python code in the project for code style violations.
However, the command does not pick up code style violations.
This is caused by an incorrect invocation of the pycodestyle package.


# Goals

- ensure that the pycodestyle package is correctly invoked
- ensure it picks up poor code style
- resolve code style issues in the current code base


# Test Plan

- review changes
- verify that existing regression tests pass
- introduce a code style issue into the code base, such as an overly long line, and verify that the command `x.py test style` reports it
