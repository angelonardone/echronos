# Motivation

The changes introduced by HaJ2AE-fix_typo_and_include_path_for_splint_static_analysis_on_windows were not effective for native splint on Windows.
Instead of passing preprocessor macro definitions and include paths to splint, the easier approach is to use custom implementations of the system headers.


# Goals

The goal of this task is to make static analysis with splint work on Linux and Windows, both with cygwin and native splint.
The approach is to implement minimal versions of the system headers for splint to include.


# Test Plan

- code review
- existing regression tests must pass
- the following commands mast pass for Linux, cygwin, and native Windows splint:
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.acamar
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.acrux
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.gatria
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.kochab
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.kraz
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.phact
    - prj/app/prj.py analyze stub.rigel
