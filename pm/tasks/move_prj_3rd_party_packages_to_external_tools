# Motivation

Currently, the 3rd-party Python packages `pystache` and `ply` are located under the directory `prj/app`.
This is inconsistent with the convention of managing 3rd party packages in the `external_tools` directory.

Furthermore, the two tools `x.py` and `prj.py` both use the pystache Python package.
Therefore, the `x.py` tool needs to specifically manipulate the Python search path for packages to be able to import it.


# Goals

- The `pystache` and `ply` packages may be updated to the most recent version.
- To improve the consistency of how 3rd party Python packages are managed, the `pystache` and `ply` packages shall be moved out of the `prj` directory into the `external_tools` directory.
- As far as possible, they shall be set up with the standard `pip` installation commands or otherwise resemble the standard directory layout created by it to maximize adoption of standard practices.
- The `x.py` and `prj.py` shall be updated to be able to import the packages from their new locations.
- The build process for the `prj` utility shall be updated so that it continues to include the packages in the `prj` executable.


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
- To build the `prj` executable and test its functionality, run the following commands:

    ./x.py build prj
    ./prj_build/prj build posix.acamar

- Verify that both commands complete successfully.
  This verifies that the `prj` executable correctly includes and uses the 3rd party packages.
