# Motivation

The command `x.py test style` is used in regression testing and currently uses the pycodestyle Python package to check the Python code in the project for code style violations.
However, its tests are relatively limited compared to the pylint package.
This package would allow the project to ensure higher Python code quality than the current regression tests do.


# Goals

- integrate the pylint Python package
- run pylint on the project Python code as part of the `x.py test style` command
- update the project Python code where necessary to pass the pylint checks


# Test Plan

- review changes
- verify that existing regression tests pass
