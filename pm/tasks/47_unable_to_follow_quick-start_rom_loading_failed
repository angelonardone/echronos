# Motivation

The instructions in the current quick-start guide in README.md are out of date and do not allow creating a system runnable in QEMU.
See GitHub issue #47 at https://github.com/echronos/echronos/issues/47


# Goals

- Update README.md so that the quick-start guide can be followed successfully.
- document the `--disable-gtk` option for building QEMU
- document or implement the need to not return -1 from the ROM loader in QEMU


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
- Follow the instructions of the quick-start guide on a Linux system and verify that they result in a working system runnable in QEMU.
