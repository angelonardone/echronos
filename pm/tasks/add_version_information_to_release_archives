# Motivation

Currently, release archives do not contain a file that indicates the version number of the release.
This makes it unnecessarily difficult for users to identify which RTOS release the extracted release archive contents correspond to.


# Goals

- Make it easily identifiable which release a set of release archive contents corresponds to.
- Release archives shall contain a file called `version_info` (similar to the existing `build_info` file) that contains the version number of the release.


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes achieve the task goals and meet project conventions.
- Verify that a release archive created from this task contains the file `version_info` with the correct version number.
